# American-Museum-of-Natural-History-Cuba-Prototype-
Game prototype details for my internship with the American Museum of History (Fall 2016-Winter 2017)

The internship was with museum's #scienceFTW after-school class that combined the topics of educational game design and the history of the AMNH’s expeditions to Cuba to produce a prototype for a tabletop game about how museum-based scientists advance knowledge.

My responsibilities were: 
* Produce weekly prototypes for a tabletop game about how museum-based scientists advance knowledge based on meetings with the game designer, Nick Fortugno.
* Play-tested with the class and balanced the game with Mr. Fortugno.
* Acted as a liaison between the museum's Education Department and the game designer to ensure that the prototyping process fit well within the class’s timeline.
